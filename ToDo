Problem A.
1. Export to dataframe the predictions
2. Create a dataframe with index categories and columns the items (one hot)
3. Step 4 from question A is already in surprise package
4. Step 5 and 6 we will see at the end

Problem B.
1. Create similarity (surprise)
   Similarity between one movie and movies which user has rated
2. Create Popularity (users who rated A/ users who rated generally)
3. Serendipity index both ways
4. Solve maximization problem x integer and x continuous for d=0 (without dissimilarity) 
   [check:pymprog library]
5. Find dissimilarity (1-similarity)
6. Step 4 with dissimilarity (d!=0)
